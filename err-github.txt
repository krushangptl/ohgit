GitHub Error Problem for Authentication!

When I first time push my local repository to remote repository on Github, 
I encounter Authentication Problem...

In Which I asked for my username, password and I get error message like that Authentication 
is already closed in 2021. I need you use other Authentication Method.

We have 2 Authentication Methods 

1. By Token 
Go to your GitHub Account -> Setting -> Token 
Generate Token and use that Token as password for Authentication or as HTTP link.

2. By SSH Key 
Generate SSH Key : https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-ssh 
Add it into your GitHub Account.

If you encounter any issue, checkout YouTube, stack overflow or Google.

Thank you!
